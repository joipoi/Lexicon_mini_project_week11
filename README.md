This is a mini project for a programming course run by Lexicon
# Comments
- I think my code could be better, there are a lot of if statements to check for different errors and it 
is a bit hard to read
- I got help from ai to write the regex
# Possible improvements
- Creating seperate methods for validating input and outputting error messages would make the code cleaner.
- I could use List<string> instead of using Array and resizing it
